# BigBrain Surface Parcellations

## BigBrain

The BigBrain is the brain of a 65 years old man with no neurological or psychiatric
diseases in clinical records at time of death. The brain was embedded in parafin and
sectioned in 7404 coronal histological sections (20 microns), stained for cell bodies.
The BigBrain is the digitized reconstruction of the hi-res histological sections 
(20 microns isotropic).

## Dataset content

This dataset contains surface parcellations from the BigBrain release 2015 
published in the [BigBrain Project website](https://bigbrainproject.org).

Commonly used surface atlases previously defined on fsaverage (Brainnetome, DKT, Economo, Schaefer2018) and HCP's fs_LR (MMP 1.0) have been mapped onto the BigBrain. Surface-based registration has been achieved using a customized MSM pipeline. 

The data is organized as follows:

- fsaverage folder: contains atlases on fsaverage projected on the resampled BigBrain surfaces in fsaverage space
- fs_LR folder: contains atlases on fs_LR projected on the resampled BigBrain surgaces in fs_LR space.
- BigBrain_space folder: contains resampled labels of the various atlases defined on the original BigBrain surfaces.
